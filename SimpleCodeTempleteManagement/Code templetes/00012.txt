[Title]VB> XML - Creating the root, a comment and a child node
Creating the root, a comment and a child node

The XML document will be built bit by bit so that the process is easy to understand, especially if the reader is a first-timer. The document above is built line by line starting from the beginning. Every XML document has a processing instruction at the very top of the document. The document must have a root element. The document may or may not have a comment, but the object model has the necessary method to create one. The code listing shown allows you to create an XML document with the root node "wroot," an element "comment" which is a child of the root, and an element "student" which is also a child of the root.
